title: Why every tool I build will be local-first

I spent last night writing a manifesto that boils down to one line:

**Your prompts never leave your device.**

Not a promise. An architectural guarantee. The app runs on your machine.
API calls go directly from your browser to the AI provider. My server
only touches the billing layer. I never see your content.

Here's why this matters and why I think the current model is broken.

## The gatekeeping problem

Want to try an AI tool? Create an account. Verify your email. Pick a plan.
Enter your credit card. Now you're locked in — paying $15/month whether you
use it once or a hundred times, getting promo emails you never asked for,
with your prompts stored on servers you can't audit.

That's not a product. That's a trap dressed up as a product.

## What I'm building instead

**No accounts.** You open the tool and use it. No username, no password,
no "sign up to continue."

**No subscriptions.** Pay for what you use, when you use it. Prepaid
credits. Top up when you want, stop when you want. Like a transit card —
not a gym membership.

**No data harvesting.** I don't store, log, or mine your inputs. My backend
handles credit deduction. The content of what you're asking bypasses me
entirely.

## The business model

I'm a utility reseller. AI providers are the power generators — I buy
wholesale tokens, sell retail. The margin between what I pay per token and
what I charge is the business. Simple, transparent, scales with usage.

Free trial on launch. Rate-limited, using my API key, so you can experience
the tool with zero friction. When you want more, you buy credits through
a one-time Stripe payment. No account created. No subscription initiated.

## Where this goes

In five years, on-device inference will handle most everyday AI tasks. The
cloud API becomes reserved for heavy lifting. When that happens, "your
prompts never leave your device" becomes even more true — and my costs
drop because I'm not paying for API calls.

The account-per-tool model will feel as outdated as remembering your AOL
login. Device-level identity and native payment rails will replace it.

I want to be building for that future. Starting now.

## First up: SpecifyThat

[SpecifyThat](https://specifythat.com) is the first tool getting rebuilt
with this philosophy. Today it's a server-side app where my API routes
see every prompt. The rebuild flips that: API routes become thin proxies
that forward to OpenAI without logging or storing what you send. My server
never writes your prompt to a database or a log. Same tool, fundamentally
different architecture.

More on that soon.
