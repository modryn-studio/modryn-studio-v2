Before Modryn Studio v2 existed, I shipped [SpecifyThat](https://specifythat.com).

The problem: I kept starting projects with a half-formed idea and
wasting the first hour of a build session figuring out what I was
actually trying to build. So I built a tool to fix that.

Thirteen targeted questions. If you don't know the answer, an AI fills
the gap using "top 0.1% thinking" for that decision. At the end, you get
a copy-ready spec to paste into Cursor, Copilot, or whatever you build with.

I never marketed it. It's not on Google Search Console. But two people
found it, signed up for updates, someone starred it, and someone forked it.
That's enough signal.

It's listed here now as beta. The AI backend is being swapped from
Anthropic to OpenAI (cost reasons — a full spec gen costs fractions of a
cent on GPT-4.1 mini). Once that's live, the status flips.

The tool has a wish list a mile long. That's a later problem.
Right now it just needs to work again.
