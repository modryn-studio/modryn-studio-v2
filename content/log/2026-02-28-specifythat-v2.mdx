The last update on SpecifyThat said it just needed to work again. It works. It's live.

But the more important thing that shipped isn't the status badge — it's clarity about what the tool actually makes.

## What shipped

- **The output is a context file, not a spec.** SpecifyThat now generates the file your AI coding tool reads at the start of every session — stack, architecture, conventions, non-goals — not a document for humans. That distinction matters. Specs sit in Notion. Context files get used.
- **v2 flow: describe once, AI fills the rest.** You write a sentence or two about your project. AI works through all 13 questions behind the scenes and comes back with a full review screen. Everything pre-filled. You adjust what's wrong — most people change nothing — then generate.
- **Works for every major AI coding tool.** Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Bolt, Copilot. Each one expects its context in a different file at a different path. The generated file works for all of them. [/how-it-works](https://specifythat.com/how-it-works) now explains where to drop it for each.
- **Multi-part support.** If your project has distinct modules or you want to spec a backend and frontend separately, you can run the flow multiple times in one session and get a file per part.

## Why

The old framing — "generate a spec" — was wrong. Nobody pastes a spec into Cursor. They paste context. Renaming it didn't change the output much, but it changed who the tool is for and how it gets used. Solo builders who want to start coding in ten minutes, not write documentation.

The v2 flow exists because the original interview — question by question, one at a time — felt like homework. The point was always to skip the planning step, not to disguise it as a chat.
