title: How I set up my Copilot workflow

Every new project I start now gets the same setup: a `.github/` folder that
turns VS Code into a disciplined co-pilot rather than an eager yes-man.

Here's what's in it.

**`@check`** — a pre-ship agent. Before every push, I type `@check` and it
reads all recently changed files, hunts for bugs, runs lint, runs a build,
and commits any fixes. It never pushes. I review the diff, then push myself.
That one habit has caught at least three dumb mistakes that would have gone
to production.

**`/init`** — new project setup. I fill in two files (`context.md` and
`brand.md`) with the product facts and brand rules, then run `/init`.
Copilot reads both and fills in the always-on instructions file that
lives in every session. Takes 5 minutes instead of 20.

**`/seo`** — pre-launch checklist. Generates `sitemap.ts`, `robots.ts`,
`manifest.ts`, and JSON-LD structured data automatically. Audits for
missing OG images and character counts. Then walks me through Google
Search Console and Bing registration step by step.

**`src/config/site.ts`** — single source of truth for the site name, URL,
description, and brand colors. Change it once and the manifest, JSON-LD,
sitemap, and metadata all update on the next build. No sync needed.

The whole thing is in a public repo at
[github.com/modryn-studio/boilerplate](https://github.com/modryn-studio/boilerplate).
Copy the `.github/` folder into any Next.js project and it works.

Built for one-person studios that ship fast and can't afford to forget things.
