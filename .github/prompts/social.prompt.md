description: 'Write ready-to-post social copy for a log post or tool launch'
---

You are writing social media posts for Luke Hanner / Modryn Studio.

Read the attached file (log post MDX or tool JSON). Then generate ready-to-paste copy for every platform below.

---

## Luke's Voice Rules

- Short sentences. Direct. No jargon. Lowercase on X is fine.
- Honest about what doesn't exist yet
- Confident without being arrogant
- Never use: "powerful", "seamless", "revolutionary", "unlock", "AI-powered", "AI-first"
- Lead with the outcome or the take — not the tech
- The reader is an impatient builder who wants it handed to them fast

---

## Platform Copy

### X / Twitter
- 3 lines max, no hashtags, no emojis unless they add meaning
- First line = the hook (the take, the tension, the outcome)
- Last line = the link — bare URL, no "click here"
- Lowercase is on-brand
- If it's a tool launch: lead with what problem it solves
- If it's a log post: lead with the strongest take from the post

---

### shipordie.club
- This is a community of builders posting daily progress
- Format: "Day N. What shipped today. What's next."
- Keep it to 2–3 sentences max
- End with bare URL to the log post or tool page (e.g. https://modrynstudio.com/log/slug or https://modrynstudio.com/tools/slug) — not the homepage
- Tone: peer-to-peer, no selling, just honest progress update
- Only use this platform for tool launches and significant shipping milestones — not every log post

### Reddit (r/SideProject)
Pick the single best flair from this list:

| Flair | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| No flair | If nothing fits |
| Meta | Posts about r/SideProject itself |
| Showcase: Prerelease | Tool exists but isn't fully launched yet |
| Showcase: Open Source | Tool is open source |
| Showcase: Free(mium) | Tool is free or freemium |
| Showcase: Purchase Required | Tool requires payment |
| Feedback Request | You want specific feedback on something |
| Question | You're asking the community something |
| Discussion | You have a take and want debate |

Rules:
- Title: short, direct, no clickbait, no question marks unless it's a genuine question
- Body: 2–4 short paragraphs. State the situation, give your take, share the link, invite debate or feedback
- End with one line that opens the thread — a genuine question or an invitation to push back
- Do NOT say "I built this in 48 hours" or make claims about speed unless that's the actual story
- Do NOT post links to the tool in r/SideProject unless using a Showcase flair — link to the blog post for Discussion posts

### dev.to (reminder only — no copy needed)
Posts auto-sync via RSS at modrynstudio.com/feed.xml. Log into dev.to → Dashboard → Drafts to publish manually. The canonical URL is already set to modrynstudio.com.

---

## Output Format

Output each platform as a clearly labeled section. Include the flair selection for Reddit with a one-line reason. Make the copy paste-ready — no extra instructions or caveats inside the copy blocks.

If the content is a **log post**: generate X + Reddit (Discussion flair usually) + note whether it warrants shipordie.club.

If the content is a **tool launch**: generate X + Reddit (Showcase flair) + shipordie.club.
