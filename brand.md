# Modryn Studio — Brand & Voice

## Voice
- Short sentences. Direct. No jargon.
- Honest about what doesn't exist yet
- Confident without being arrogant
- Never use: "powerful", "seamless", "revolutionary", "unlock"

## The User
Impatient people who hate bad software and don't want to 
do the research. They want it handed to them. Fast.

## Visual Rules
- Dark mode base, system toggle
- Accent: Amber / Burnt Orange
- Fonts: Space Grotesk (headlines) + Space Mono (badges/log/code)
- Minimal motion. One scroll fade max.
- No fake testimonials, no stock photos, no popups

## Emotional Arc
Land → "Wait, this is different"
Read → "This person actually builds real things"
Scroll → "I want to follow this journey"
Convert → "I don't want to miss the next one"

## Copy Examples (Use These as Reference)
- Hero: "Tools for people who don't have time for bad software."
